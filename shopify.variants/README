Variant Metafields Display on Website Description

Background and Behind Story Logistics: 

This project was built in a real production environment for a furniture e-commerce company.
At the time, we had already launched Google Ads Performance Max (PMax) campaigns, which are known to be both powerful and costly. PMax explores
multiple Google-owned placements to identify high-converting audiences, but this learning process often takes weeks or even months.
During early campaign stages, traffic volume increased, but conversion performance heavily depended on landing page quality.
From Google Analytics (GA4), we observed a critical issue: most users spent less than 3 seconds on the website before leaving.
This made one thing clear: The landing page experience is the first and most important conversion lever once a user clicks an ad.

## Problem Statement

With limited budget and an active ad campaign already running, rebuilding the entire website or hiring a new agency was not feasible.

However, we still needed to improve perceived quality and usability to match industry leaders such as RH, CB2, Visual Comfort, and Pottery Barn — without enterprise-level resources.

The challenge became:
- How to improve product detail landing pages quickly
- How to present complex specifications clearly
- How to do this within Shopify’s constraints and limited Shopify Built-in features

## Step 1: Research and Feasibility Validation

Before writing any code, the first question was whether this idea was technically feasible within Shopify’s constraints.

To answer that, I started with a focused research phase:
- Reviewing Shopify documentation (metafields, variants, Liquid)
- Studying implementation patterns shared by developers
- Watching walkthroughs and reproducing logic step by step

The goal was not to copy code, but to understand the underlying data flow and determine whether a scalable solution was possible.

Through this process, a clear implementation plan emerged:

1. Define variant-level metafields for specification data
2. Populate metafields across all product variants
3. Connect metafields to variants via Liquid
4. Render specification data on the product page
5. Debug edge cases and rendering issues
6. Refine UI details (button styles, typography, spacing)

This step ensured that the solution was technically sound before moving into full implementation.

## Shopify Variant Metafields Setup

To support variant-level specifications, the first step was defining custom metafields directly in Shopify Admin.

Instead of relying on product-level fields, metafields were created at the **variant scope**, allowing each option (e.g. size, finish) to carry its own specification data.
