# Variant Metafields Display on Website Description

## Step 1: Background

This project was built in a real production environment for a furniture
e-commerce company.

At the time, we had already launched **Google Ads Performance Max (PMax)**
campaigns, which are known to be both **powerful and costly**. PMax explores
multiple Google-owned placements to identify high-converting audiences, but
this learning process often takes weeks or even months.

During early campaign stages, traffic volume increased, but **conversion
performance heavily depended on landing page quality**.

From Google Analytics (GA4), we observed a critical issue:
most users spent **less than 3 seconds** on the website before leaving.

This made one thing clear:
> **The landing page experience is the first and most important conversion
lever once a user clicks an ad.**

## Problem Statement

With limited budget and an active ad campaign already running, rebuilding the
entire website or hiring a new agency was not feasible.

However, we still needed to improve perceived quality and usability to match
industry leaders such as **RH, CB2, Visual Comfort, and Pottery Barn**—without
enterprise-level resources.

The challenge became:
- How to improve product detail pages quickly
- How to present complex specifications clearly
- How to do this **within Shopify’s constraints**
